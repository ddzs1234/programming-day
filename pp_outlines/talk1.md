# A Deeper Introduction to the Python Language

This topic covers stuffs such as the strengh and weakness of Python, what it can do, some fancy showcases as well.

## What is Python?

- Python is a programming language invented by Guido van Rossum;

- A "Programming language" is actually a "Protocol" to tell the computer what to do; The difference between a language and its implementations (e.g. Python vs. CPython, IronPython, Jython, PyPy); 

> Any problem in computer science can be solved with another layer of indirection.   -- David Wheeler 

- Compiled language vs. Interpreted Language (use this to introduce the strength and weakness of Python in next section);

## Why Python?

- strength of Python: 
    - Easy to learn: I prefer interpreters to compilers;
    - Good syntax: e.g. `A is not None`, list(dict)-comprehension, indent(beauty? or `vernier caliper warning.jpg`)
    - Strongly typed, dynamic;
    - Many existing packages. If you're writing more than 100 lines of code to solve a single problem, there must have been an existing package to solve it; 
    - Glue language;
    - It's fast to develop with Python.
    
BUT,

> Any problem in computer science can be solved with another layer of indirection. 

...
>But that usually will create another problem

- weakness of Python:
    - pure Python is tooooooooooo slow;
    - CPython, GIL;
    - Type checking;
    - Python 2/3;
    - Source code is visible to all users.

## Who wants to use Python?

- Manipulate data;
- Web;
- Batch operation;
- Operation and maintenance
- ...

## How to use Python?

- Get a Python interpreter;
- find yourself a good IDE/editor;
- Stick with the documents;
- Some books:
    - [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)
    - Fluent Python
